## üéØ About This Repository

This repository serves as a dedicated space to:

* **Highlight JavaScript Proficiency:** Present clear, functional JavaScript code demonstrating core language features and problem-solving skills.
* **Showcase Diverse Applications:** Include various types of JavaScript implementations, from fundamental utilities to object-oriented designs.
* **Document My Progress:** Provide a structured overview of my learning and application of JavaScript concepts.

## üìö Included Code Examples

Each section below details a specific JavaScript code example or utility included in this repository.

### 1. Basic Arithmetic Utilities

This module (`calculatorUtils.JS`) provides fundamental arithmetic functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division). Each function processes two numerical inputs and returns a formatted string illustrating the operation and its result, ideal for console-based logging or simple output.

* **Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * Function definition and parameters.
    * Basic arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
    * String interpolation (template literals).
    * Console output (`console.log`).
* **Code Location:** [`/calculatorUtils.JS`](./calculatorUtils.JS)

### 2. Mini School Simulator (OOP)

This module (`mini-school-simulator-oop.JS`) demonstrates fundamental object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in JavaScript through the definition of `Students` and `Teachers` classes. It showcases class constructors, property encapsulation, and method implementation for simulating interactions within a school environment, such as students attending class, raising hands, and teachers adding/subtracting points or explaining topics.

* **Key Concepts Demonstrated:**
    * ES6 Class syntax (`class`, `constructor`).
    * Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles: Encapsulation (properties and methods within classes).
    * Instance creation and manipulation.
    * Method definition and invocation.
    * Inter-object communication between class instances.
* **Code Location:** [`/mini-school-simulator-oop.JS`](./mini-school-simulator-oop.JS)

## üöÄ How to Run Code Examples Locally

To execute any of these JavaScript code examples on your machine, you will need **Node.js** installed.

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/joseernesto-dev/javascript-showcase.git](https://github.com/joseernesto-dev/javascript-showcase.git)
    ```
    *(Remember to replace `joseernesto-dev` with your GitHub username if it's different)*

2.  **Navigate to the root of the repository:**
    ```bash
    cd javascript-showcase
    ```

3.  **Execute the JavaScript file using Node.js:**
    ```bash
    node calculatorUtils.JS
    # Or for the OOP example:
    node mini-school-simulator-oop.JS
    ```

    You will see the output directly in your terminal.
